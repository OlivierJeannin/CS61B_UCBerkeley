BucketsSpeedTest:
With L = 1000, all types of buckets have nearly identical performance when N is in the tens of thousands.
For very large N (e.g. one million), however, buckets implemented as ArrayList or LinkedList
take twice as long as those made from other data structures.

InsertRandomSpeedTest:
The time taken by ULLMap grows rapidly when N is increased by 10,000, and heap memory is soon out.
In contrast, execution times of MyHashMap and Java's built-in HashMap are roughly on the same order.
Both grows linearly with N, which means each add operation takes constant time.

InsertInOrderSpeedTest:
When the input strings are sorted, implementations using trees without balancing would easily degenerate
to linked lists rather than trees.
Since balancing takes extra time, each add operation in TreeMaps is slower than in HashMap.

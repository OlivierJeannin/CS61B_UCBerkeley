# CS 61B - UC Berkeley

This is my personal solutions to the coding assignments for the [Spring25 semester](https://sp25.datastructur.es/) of the course.

Some of the problems might be left unsolved because I don't have the official Beacon access.

None of my solutions are tested on the official autograder Gradescope because of the [audition policy](https://sp25.datastructur.es/policies/#auditing-cs61b) of the course.

## For Project 2

The links to .zip data files on the Spring 2025 course pages are not accessible for me. I end up with using links from Fall 2024 pages for this project.
